"# random_code" 
band.py extracts useful information like Fermi energy, energy minimum 
from coduction band, energy maximum from valence band and band gap 
from .bands files (SIESTA)

grafeno1.py and grafeno2.py creates graphene square and hexagonal supercells 
in a .xyz format, ready to be executed in programs like "Jmol"
